# rspec-cucumber.vim

This is a lightweight RSpec / Cucumber runner for Vim and MacVim.
This is based off the original vim-rspec by thoughtbot:
[vim-rspec](https://github.com/thoughtbot/vim-rspec)

## Installation

Recommended installation with [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

```vim
Plugin 'michaeldeol/vim-rspec-cucumber'
```

If using zsh on OS X it may be necessary to move `/etc/zshenv` to `/etc/zshrc`.

## Configuration

### Key mappings

Add your preferred key mappings to your `.vimrc` file.

```vim
" rspec-cucumber.vim mappings
map <Leader>t :call RunCurrentTestFile()<CR>
map <Leader>s :call RunNearestTest()<CR>
map <Leader>l :call RunLastTest()<CR>
map <Leader>a :call RunAllTests()<CR>
```

### Custom runners

Overwrite the `g:test_runner` variable to set a custom launch script. At the
moment there are two MacVim-specific runners, i.e. `os_x_terminal` and
`os_x_iterm`. The default is `os_x_terminal`, but you can set this to anything
you want, provided you include the appropriate script inside the plugin's
`bin/` directory.

#### iTerm instead of Terminal

If you use iTerm, you can set `g:test_runner` to use the included iterm
launching script. This will run the specs in the last session of the current
terminal.

```vim
let g:test_runner = "os_x_iterm"
```
